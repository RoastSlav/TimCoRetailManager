# TimCoRetailManager
Project from a course.

This course focuses on real-world development. As such, it will be simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change and we will have to change and update technologies.
